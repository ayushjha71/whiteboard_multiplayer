Multiplayer Whiteboard System (Unity + Photon Fusion)

Multiplayer Whiteboard System project, I chose to implement Photon Fusion (Shared Mode) as the networking solution within the Unity engine. This setup offers a reliable, scalable, and easy-to-integrate approach for building a real-time collaborative drawing experience across multiple platforms, including Android, WebGL, and PC.

ðŸŽ¯ Why Photon Fusion (Shared Mode)?

Cross-Platform Multiplayer

Photon Fusion supports seamless multiplayer interaction across mobile, browser, and desktop devices. With a single codebase, users on different platforms can draw and collaborate in real time.

Shared Simulation Mode

The whiteboard uses Fusionâ€™s Shared Mode, where one client acts as the host and others synchronize with the host's state. This is ideal for lightweight applications like whiteboards, where real-time accuracy and simplicity matter more than full server authority.

Real-Time State Synchronization

Using Fusionâ€™s built-in NetworkTransform and RPCs, the system synchronizes drawing strokes frame-by-frame. This ensures smooth and consistent rendering of lines across all devices.

Late Join Support

When a new player joins the session, they automatically receive the current state of the whiteboard, including all previous drawings. This is handled using Networked Lists and replayable commands for a consistent user experience.

Minimal Latency

Photon Fusion is optimized for low-latency updates, which is essential for drawing interactions that rely on precision and timing.

ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Highlights

Drawing Synchronization: Real-time updates via RPCs and shared input handling

Late Join Handling: Networked state replay for new players to see existing drawings

Cross-Platform Build: Optimized for Android touch input, WebGL browser support, and PC mouse input

Photon Fusion Integration: Reliable state sync with simple architecture

Session Management: Host-based session with auto join/leave detection

This system can be extended for use in virtual classrooms, online collaboration tools, metaverse creative hubs, or game UI sketches, making it a flexible foundation for a variety of multiplayer experiences.
